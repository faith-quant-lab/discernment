1. DataDescription.ipynb

Open DataDescription.ipynb to see descriptions of data inside the data/ directory.

If Github is not showing the file, you can use the colab shared document directly at:

If running DataDescription.ipynb in Google Colaboratory, one would need to upload the data/ directory to the VM instance top level directory.
